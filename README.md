# Shipping_Consignment_Pricing_Prediction

# Problem Statement:

The market for logistics analytics is expected to develop at a CAGR of 17.3 percent
from 2019 to 2024, more than doubling in size. This data demonstrates how logistics
organizations are understanding the advantages of being able to predict what will
happen in the future with a decent degree of certainty. Logistics leaders may use this
data to address supply chain difficulties, cut costs, and enhance service levels all at the
same time.

The main goal is to predict the consignment pricing based on the available factors in the
dataset.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
